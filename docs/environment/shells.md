## Powershell

### Powershell Core 6.0+

The stock version of Powershell that ships with Windows (5.1) is not actively maintained, but in some variant of long term maintenance mode. As such it is not particularly useful for new development, but more-so for providing support for existing scripts and programs.

A branch of Powershell called Powershell Core 6.0 is the current, actively maintained version of Powershell.

One of the principle differences between Powershell 5.1 and Powershell Core is that the former is relies on the .NET framework where-as the later is built on .NET Core. As a result Powershell Core is cross platform
(anywhere .NET is supported) and plain Powershell is Windows only.

### Installation

Powershell Core is installed following the instructions on the [PowerShell GitHub](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).
